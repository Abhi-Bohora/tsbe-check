Changelog
=========

See the `releases for ts-backend-check <https://github.com/activist-org/ts-backend-check/releases>`_ for an up-to-date list of versions and their release dates.

``ts-backend-check`` tries to follow `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`_, a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH version where increments are made of the:

- **MAJOR** version when we make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes

Emojis for the following are chosen based on `gitmoji <https://gitmoji.dev/>`_.

[Upcoming] ts-backend-check 1.0.0
