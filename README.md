### Check TypeScript types against backend models

`tsbe-check` is a Python package used to check TypeScript types against their corresponding backend models to assure that all fields have been accounted for.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
pip install tsbe-check
```

### Basic Usage

The CLI provides a simple interface to check TypeScript types against backend models:

```bash
# Show help and available commands
tsbe-check --help

# Check a TypeScript type against a backend model
tsbe-check check <typescript_file> <backend_model>

# Example
tsbe-check check src/types/user.ts src/models/user.py
```

### Command Options

- `check`: Compare TypeScript types with backend models
  - `typescript_file`: Path to the TypeScript interface/type file
  - `backend_model`: Path to the backend model file (e.g. Python class)

Also check the [`-next release-`](https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check/labels/-next%20release-) and [`-priority-`](https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check/labels/-priority-) labels in the [issues](https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check/issues) for those that are most important, as well as those marked [`good first issue`](https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that are tailored for first-time contributors. For those new to coding or our tech stack, we've collected [links to helpful documentation pages](CONTRIBUTING.md#learning-the-tech-stack-) in the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Environment setup [`‚áß`](#contents)

1. First and foremost, please see the suggested IDE setup in the dropdown below to make sure that your editor is ready for development.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> <details><summary>Suggested IDE setup</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> VS Code
>
> Install the following extensions:
>
> - [charliermarsh.ruff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff)
> - [streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
>
> </p>
> </details>

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [tsbe-check repo](https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/tsbe-check.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) üîë

> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tsbe-check.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd tsbe-check
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/activist-org/tsbe-check.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (tsbe-check repository)

3. Create a virtual environment, activate it and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Unix or MacOS:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   # After activating venv:
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # To install the CLI for local development:
   pip install -e .
   ```

You're now ready to work on `tsbe-check`!
